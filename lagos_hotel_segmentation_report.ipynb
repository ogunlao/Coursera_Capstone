    "Lagos is the commercial city and the second most populous city in Nigeria. It has a thriving business community and welcomes people from various places within and outside Nigeria for business. Due to this, Hotels and Lodgement areas are good businesses which have opportunity to sell their market and create comfort. These hotels have varying grades, facilities, room sizes etc. Most times, customers clutter on the Island (the rich communities of Lagos)  with the idea that the best hotels can only be found there. By creating a cluster using their facilities, customer ratings and room sizes, customers can see Hotels in the same category domiciled in other areas of Lagos where they can still have the same comfort, reducing congestion on the Lagos Island and also creating diversity in commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target audience are visitors who would like to compare hotels in various areas based on services they offer and facilities they have."

    "2. Next, I searched for hotels around a 3000m range for the first LGA, to get an idea of how to get out features from the JSON file returned, before automating the process for other LGAs\n",
    "3. Created functions to get the data for other LGAS\n",
    "4. Next, I diplayed the hotels on a map to show thier various locations in Lagos\n",
    "5. I joined the facilities data gotten from hotels.ng to the dataframe and performed a onehot encoding\n",
    "6. I then cleaned the data since there were duplicates of facilities in some instances. I also merged similar facilities  \n",
    "I was left with 92 unique facilities to explore\n",

    "The data gotten from hotels.ng were incomplete. Some facilities that some hotels have may not have been listed and could have given false values. It is recommended to update the facilities for each hotel if it is to be used for a commercial venture."
